  			<h1>The Sands of Separation</h1>
        <h3>Section 1: The Connector</h3>
  			<p>Gentrification, the process of renovating and improving a neighborhood, often results in the displacement of its original residents, particularly in low-income and minority communities. The case of Peoplestown, a historic Black neighborhood in Atlanta, Georgia, is a prime example of how gentrification has affected communities across the United States.</p>
        <p>Peoplestown was established in the late 1800s as a working-class neighborhood for Black families who were employed by the nearby railroad and brick factories. Over time, the neighborhood became home to a tight-knit community with its own churches, schools, and businesses.</p>
        <p>The Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956 expanded America’s interstate highway system. Barely a year later, the city conceived of an urban renewal plan and bought about 600 acres of land in portions of Summerhill, Mechanicsville, and Peoplestown, removing thousands of Black residents and closing more than 100 Black-owned businesses to make room for housing, businesses, schools, and parks that would attract middle-income, largely white families. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently acknowledged that racism was built into many of the decisions on where to locate those freeways. </p>

        <p id="2">“When you look at the history of these highway developments through historic communities, you are seeing with your own eyes structural racism in the most literal sense of the word,” said U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, who is now the pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and his father served as co-pastors. “Ironically, just as Dr. King was bringing us all together through his vision of ‘beloved community,’ their communities were literally being separated around the same era.”</p>
        <p>The effects of urban development and gentrification are not limited to the displacement of Black residents, but also include the erasure of Black culture and history.</p>

        <h3>Section 2: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Assassination'</h3>
        <p>The expansion of Atlanta’s highways came during a time of struggle for social justice, and a decade before the assassination of a key social activist for the black community.  In the days after  Dr. Martin Luther King died, riots broke out in more than 100 cities across America. More than 50,000 National Guard troops – the largest domestic military deployment since the Civil War – were mobilized around the country. But King’s hometown of Atlanta avoided the unrest. Services began with a small memorial at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King and his father served as co-pastors.</p>
        <p>Among those packed into the chapel were the four candidates for president in 1968 – Richard Nixon, Hubert Humphrey, Eugene McCarthy, and Robert Kennedy (who would himself be assassinated two months later) – along with civil rights leaders including Thurgood Marshall, Andrew Young and Jesse Jackson and entertainers and athletes like Harry Belafonte, Wilt Chamberlain, and Jim Brown. One moment, in particular, struck the mourners inside the church and the thousands listening outside: the sound of King’s own voice. Two months before he was killed, King delivered a sermon at Ebenezer where he imagined his own funeral. Now a recording of those words rang through the church’s speakers.</p>
        <p>King asked that rather than talking about his Nobel Peace Prize or hundreds of other awards, he’d like someone to mention how he “tried to give his life serving others,” “to feed the hungry” and “tried to love and serve humanity.” After that service, King’s casket was loaded onto a mule-driven wooden farm cart as a striking symbol of his commitment to the impoverished in the Poor People’s Campaign, a demand for economic justice.</p>
        <p>The cart then began a three-mile journey through Atlanta’s streets to a second memorial, this one at King’s alma mater, Morehouse College. It was, at that time, the largest funeral for a private citizen in the United States.</p>
        <p id="3">Fast forward a few years to Peoplestown, a historically black neighborhood in Atlanta that King would have been proud of. Before gentrification set in, the area was a hub of black culture, with residents who had lived there for generations. It was a place where neighbors sat on their front porches and knew each other's stories, where children played ball in the street, and people knew where to go for the best soul food in town.</p>
        <p>One of those residents was Carolyn Calhoun, who had lived in her home on the block since the 1970s. She and her neighbors were proud of their neighborhood, despite its challenges. They had survived the crack epidemic of the 1980s, the foreclosure crisis of the late 2000s, and the closure of their elementary school. But nothing could have prepared them for what was to come.</p>

        <h3>Section 3: '96 Olympics</h3>
        <p>In the lead-up to the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta's city leaders marketed the city as a hub of economic progress and civil rights, but at the same time, around 30,000 low-income residents were displaced. In an effort to portray a polished image to the world, thousands of homeless people, mostly African American, were unlawfully arrested and incarcerated.</p>
        <p>The area where the Olympic Stadium was built had a history of flooding, so the city constructed two culverts to redirect run-off water into a junction box under the Peoplestown neighborhood. However, the Georgia Department of Transportation had previously assured the communities that a relief trunk line would be constructed through a wealthier and predominantly white neighborhood to relieve pressure on the combined sewer and water system in Peoplestown, but this was never built. Consequently, the poor and Black neighborhood was disrupted, while the wealthy and white neighborhood was not.  This demonstrates a broader pattern of prioritizing economic progress and an attractive city image at the expense of low-income and minority neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>In 2012, a series of storms resulted in severe flooding on Washington’s block, as runoff rainwater overwhelmed a combined water and sewage system built beneath it and caused a major overspill. This was a direct result of the city failing to construct necessary water system relief line. At least six homes were damaged. At least six homes, leading residents to sue the city for failure to upgrade the combined water and sewage system beneath it. The city covered the costs of repairs and cleaning but did not finish all repairs, leading to further legal action.</p>
        <p id="4">About a year later, in 2013, the city offered to buy the damaged homes as part of a settlement with the families and in order to construct a pond on the location of the overspill to mitigate flooding in the neighborhood. The city allegedly told the residents that if they did not accept the city’s offer, they would end up receiving far less in the future and warned them the city was planning to eventually take the whole block of homes anyway.</p>
        <p>While a few of the families settled with the city at this time and parted with their homes, most opted to refuse the city’s offers and stay. In 2014, however, the city approved the use of “eminent domain” – which allows the government to expropriate private property for public use.  In 2015, the other families on the block received letters from the city informing them it would need to acquire their properties.</p>

        <h3>Section 4: Master Plan of the New Park</h3>
        <p>The decision to invoke eminent domain and demolish homes to make way for a $65 million green infrastructure project in Peoplestown, Atlanta, has transformed the neighborhood. But the transformation has come at a great cost to the original residents, who now face antagonism from some of the newcomers trickling into the neighborhood. These new residents, with their designer dogs and posh lifestyles, seem to believe that the original residents of Peoplestown have no place in the rapidly gentrifying community.</p>
        <p>The original families on the block, who refused to leave their homes and fought the city, are now only a few remaining against the onslaught of bulldozers, paving trucks, and construction crews. They are standing on the edge of their properties, watching the old houses being torn down one by one, and the empty lots turned into green space. Their houses are still standing, but for how long? The city is biding its time, waiting for the moment when they can get their hands on the final few holdouts.</p>
        <p>The new green infrastructure project planned for Peoplestown, which includes a Japanese garden, gazebos, retention ponds, and bio-retention areas to treat stormwater, is expected to be a symbol of the city's commitment to environmental sustainability. But what about its commitment to the people who once called this place home? For these residents, the project is nothing more than a slap in the face, a reminder of their lost homes, and the city's disregard for their lives.</p>
        <p id="5">The original residents of Peoplestown, who have been living in the area for over half a century, feel like they are being pushed out of their own homes. The newcomers act like they have the right to displace them as if they have some kind of divine right to the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>However, the original residents often face antagonism from some newcomers who see them as the outsiders. “They look at us like we don’t belong here,” Calhoun says, gesturing to the homes across the street. “Some of them can’t wait until they tear our houses down and get to walk their dogs in their little park. They act like us being here for 50 years is somehow interfering with their lives.”</p>

        <h3>Section 5: Church Demolished</h3>
        <p>Recently, a law professor at Georgia State University, Tanya Washington, who has been living in Peoplestown for a decade, recalled her memories of the community. She remembered an old Black church, which was at least half a century old, situated across the street from her home. The church, which was over 50 years old, had been a staple of the community and a source of comfort for its residents.</p>
        <p id="6">“On Sunday morning when I woke up, I heard the sounds of old spirituals like my grandmother used to sing in her choir when I would visit her in South Georgia,” Washington recalls.  She chuckles at this memory of a neighborhood that quickly became her home. “It was a beautiful church. I thought how incredible it was that I got to wake up and listen to this every Sunday morning.”</p>
        <p>However, the church was sold to private realtors, who targeted Peoplestown, and the pews were moved out onto the lawn and sold one by one. The demolition of the church was a symbol of the loss of community and the erasure of history that gentrification often brings.  The site where the church once stood is now home to cookie-cutter suburban houses.</p>

        <h3>Section 6: Original Residents</h3>
        <p>Dwayne Adgar, 46, is one of the last unmovable residents on Peoplestown’s contested block. He lives on Ormond Street. Blue paint peels down from the sides of his modest home, giving it a rundown look compared to the freshly painted tract homes and mini-mansions taking over the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Adgar bought his home 20 years ago and paid in cash, he says, because at that time banks would not issue home loans for the area. “Fast forward 10 years, and they’re giving white folks home loans, remodeling loans, this loan, that loan, get your house torn down and build another one on top of it loan,” Adgar says.</p>
        <p>The story of Peoplestown is also one of community engagement and activism, and the people who dedicated their lives to fighting for their community. Ruby Jackson was one such person, who lived in the neighborhood for more than 50 years before her death at age 98. At just 14, she began her commitment to community engagement and activism, going door-to-door to collect money from residents to get them access to indoor plumbing and electricity. Her daughter, Calhoun, remembers a time when Peoplestown was a neighborhood where everyone knew each other, and neighbors helped each other out. But the construction of the interstates and urban renewal plans caused the community to fracture.</p>
        <p>Washington, who had stopped by the Darden’s home for a visit, interjects: “If this is another one of the city’s intimidation tactics, they will be disappointed because we’re not intimidated. I look at it as a positive – like wow, now we got the police protecting us.” She throws back her head and laughs.</p>
        <p>The current residents of Peoplestown have faced systemic harassment from the city as they fight to keep their homes. The city has repeatedly targeted the residents with code inspections, even after their homes have passed inspection. In addition, the city sent a company to shut off their gas without warning, in preparation for demolitions. The police have also been surveilling the contested block and parking outside residents' homes, which the city denies.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, the case of Peoplestown is a stark example of how gentrification can displace communities, erase history, and perpetuate inequality. While development and revitalization can be positive forces, they must be done with care and respect for the communities they affect. Only then can we ensure that neighborhoods like Peoplestown can continue to thrive and evolve without sacrificing their cultural and historical significance.</p>
